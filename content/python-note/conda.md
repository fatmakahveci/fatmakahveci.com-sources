- It is a package, dependency, and environment management.
- It was created for Python, but it is also used for R, Java, C/C++, etc.
- It runs on macOS, Linux, etc.
- If you need a package that requires another version of Python, use `conda`.
- Use the most recent version.

## miniconda vs. anaconda

### miniconda

- Choose if you are a newbie to python and have the time and disk space.

- Install 1,500 scientific packages automatically installed __at once__.

- Every time you open up a terminal, `conda` wonâ€™t automatically be available. Run the command below to use `conda` within `miniconda`.

> export PATH=$HOME/miniconda/bin:$PATH

### anaconda

- Install each package separately.

## Installation

- [macOS](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)
- [Linux](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/linux/)
- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/u/continuumio)

### Update packages

`> conda update conda`

- It is friendly with _pip_. It means that if you can't find a package in Anaconda Cloud, you can install it using _pip_.

## Creating a `conda` environment

- There are two ways of creating a `conda` environment.

### 1. An environment file in YAML

- __YAML :=__ YAML Ain't Markup Language

environment.yml

```yaml
name: <environment_name>
channels:
- conda-forge
dependencies:
- python=<python_version>
- pip
- pip:
    - <pip_package_name>
```

- To create an environment:

`> conda env create --file <environment.yml>`

### 2. Manual specification of packages

`> conda create -c conda-forge -n <environment_name> python=<python_version> <pip_package_name_1> <pip_package_name_2> <...>`

- conda env remove -n live_env

- To activate an environment:

`> conda activate <environment_name>`

- To deactivate an environment:

`> conda deactivate`

- To delete an environment:

`> conda env remove -n <environment_name>`

- To see the packages in an environment:

`> conda list -n test_env`

- To add a package to an existing environment:

`> conda install --name <environment_name> -c <chanel_name> <package_name>`

- Get a list of all my environments (Active environment shown with *)

`> conda info -e`
