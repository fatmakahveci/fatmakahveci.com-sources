- It is a problem-solving approach, where all computations are carried out using objects.
- It bundles related properties and behaviours into individual objects to structure a program.
  - An object may represent a person with `properties` like name, and `behaviours` like walking.
- The program is divided into small parts called objects.
- It follows a bottom-up approach.
- It has access specifiers like private, public, protected, etc.
- Adding new data and functions is easy.
- It provides data hiding so it is more secure than procedural programming.
- It allows overloading.
- Data is more important than function.
- It provides the ability to simulate the real world.
- i.e. C++, Java, Python, C#, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP, VB.NE, etc.

## Terminologies

### Class

- A class is a group of objects that share common properties and behaviour. It is a blueprint or template from which objects are created.

### Object

- Object is any real-world entity that can have some characteristics or which can perform some tasks. It is also called the instance of a class.
