- The Lambda functions are a way of creating small anonymous functions.
- They are functions without a name.
- lambda arguments: return expression

```python
lambda x, y: x + y
```

- Lambda functions are mainly used in combination with the functions `filter()`, `map()`, and `reduce()`.
  - map() function applies the function f on each element in the sequences.
