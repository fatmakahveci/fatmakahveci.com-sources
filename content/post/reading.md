# 1. Limitless

## Seven LIES (Limited Ideas Entertaining)

### 1. ~~Intelligence is fixed.~~ Intelligence is fluid.

- "This is something I'm not good at yet."

### 2. ~~We only use 10 percent of our brains.~~ We use our brains as a whole.

- "I am learning to use my whole brain in the best way possible."

### 3. ~~Mistakes are failures.~~ Mistakes are a sign that you are trying something new.

- There is no such thing as a failure. Only failure to learn.

### 4. ~~Knowledge is power.~~ Knowledge only has the potential to be power.

- Knowledge x Action = Power

### 5. ~~Learning new things is very difficult.~~ Sometimes it is hard to learn new things.

- When you learn how to learn, the challenge of learning can be fun.

### 6. ~~The criticism of other people matters.~~ People will criticize you no matter what you do.

- It is not your job to like, love, or respect me. It is mine.

### 7. ~~Genius is born.~~ Genius leaves clues. There is always a method behind what looks like magic.

- Genius is not born; it is made through deep practice.

# 2. Atomic Habits

- The backbone is the four-step model of habits are cue, craving, response, and reward.

- Behavioral scientists realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way.

- It explains how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior because our moods and emotions matter too.

- If you can get 1 percent __better__ each day for one year, you will end up __thirty-seven__ times better by the time you're done.

- If you can get 1 percent __worse__ each day for one year, you will decline nearly down to __zero__.

- Success is the product of daily habits.

- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure.

- Warren Buffet: "That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest."

## Your Habits Can Compound For You or Against You

### Positive Compounding

- Productivity compounds:
    - Automating an old task
    - Mastering a new skill
- Knowledge compounds:
    - Learning one new idea
- Relationships compounds:
    - Being a little bit nicer in each interaction

### Negative Compounding

- Stress compounds:
    - The frustration of a traffic jam
    - The weight of parenting responsibilities
    - The worry of making ends meet
    - The strain of slightly high blood pressure
- Negative thoughts compounds:
    + The more you think yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way.
    + Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.
- Outrage compounds:
    + Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely result of single event. Instead, a long series of microagressions.

---

- The San Antonio Spurs is one of the most successful teams in NBA history:
    + "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it-but all that had gone before."

#### The Plateau of Latent Potential

- All big things come from small beginnings.

#### Forget About Goals, Focus on Systems Instead

- Three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh: "The score takes care of itself."

- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
   - You need to solve the problems at the systems level.
   - Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
   - Goals create an "either-or" conflict: either you succeed or failed.
   - You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.
- Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
   - True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It is not about any single accomplishment.

#### A System of Atomic Habits

- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.

- The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

### 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:

  1. We try to change the wrong thing.

     __Three layers of behavior change__

     __i. Changing your outcomes:__ Changing your results. Most of the goals are at this level. i.e. losing weight.

     __ii. Changing your processes:__ Changing your habits and systems. Most of the habits are at this level. i.e. developing a meditation practice.

     __iii. Changing your identity:__ Changing your beliefs. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are at this level. i.e. your worldview.

  2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way.

- Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.

- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.

- Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg.

- Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work.
