### 1 Seven LIES (Limited Ideas Entertaining)

#### 1.1 ~~Intelligence is fixed.~~ Intelligence is fluid

- "This is something I'm not good at yet."

#### 1.2 ~~We only use 10 percent of our brains.~~ We use our brains as a whole

- "I am learning to use my whole brain in the best way possible."

#### 1.3 ~~Mistakes are failures.~~ Mistakes are a sign that you are trying something new

- There is no such thing as a failure. Only failure to learn.

#### 1.4 ~~Knowledge is power.~~ Knowledge only has the potential to be power

- Knowledge x Action = Power

#### 1.5 ~~Learning new things is very difficult.~~ Sometimes it is hard to learn new things

- When you learn how to learn, the challenge of learning can be fun.

#### 1.6 ~~The criticism of other people matters.~~ People will criticize you no matter what you do

- It is not your job to like, love, or respect me. It is mine.

#### 1.7 ~~Genius is born.~~ Genius leaves clues. There is always a method behind what looks like magic

- Genius is not born; it is made through deep practice.
