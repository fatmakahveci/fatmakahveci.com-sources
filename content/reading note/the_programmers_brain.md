## [The programmers brain](https://www.manning.com/books/the-programmers-brain)

### 1 Cognitive processes in programming

- Confusion is acceptable for a while when you start to work in a new domain. Not knowing the meaning of a concept and trying to read complex code are distinct ways of confusion. Each relates to a different cognitive process.
- Three ways of confusion:
  - __A lack of knowledge:=__ issue in long-term memory (LTM)
    - e.g., not knowing the meaning of an operator.
    - The relevant facts are insufficient in your LTM.
  - __Lack of information:=__ issue in short-term memory (STM)
    - e.g., not knowing the inner workings of a function.
    - STM stores information temporarily.
  - __Lack of processing power:=__ issue in working memory
    - You cannot process the entire execution despite an educated guess.

- Three cognitive processes:
  - __Long-term memory:=__ a computer's hard drive
    - LTM is involved in everything we do.
    - e.g., writing binary search requires you to remember
      - the abstract algorithm
      - the syntax of the programming language (PL)
      - how to type on a keyboard
  - __Short_term memory:__ a computer's RAM or cache
    - e.g., keywords, variable names, and data structures when reading a program.
    - The estimated size of an STM is not more than a dozen of items.
    - STM is emptied when you solve the problem.
  - __Working memory:__ a computer's processor
    - You do tracing and other cognitively complex tasks here.
      - _Tracing_ is the mental compiling and executing of code.
    - You form new thoughts, ideas, and solutions here.
