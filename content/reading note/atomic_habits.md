## [Atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits)

- The backbone is the four-step model of habits are cue, craving, response, and reward.
- Behavioral scientists realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way.
- It explains how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior because our moods and emotions matter too.
- If you can get 1 percent __better__ each day for one year, you will end up __thirty-seven__ times better by the time you're done.
- If you can get 1 percent __worse__ each day for one year, you will decline nearly down to __zero__.
- Success is the product of daily habits.
- Time magnifies the margin between success and failure.
- Warren Buffet: "That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest."

### 1 Your Habits Can Compound For You or Against You

#### 1.1 Positive Compounding

- Productivity compounds:
  - Automating an old task
  - Mastering a new skill
- Knowledge compounds:
  - Learning one new idea
- Relationships compounds:
  - Being a little bit nicer in each interaction

#### 1.2 Negative Compounding

- Stress compounds:
  - The frustration of a traffic jam
  - The weight of parenting responsibilities
  - The worry of making ends meet
  - The strain of slightly high blood pressure
- Negative thoughts compounds:
  - The more you think yourself as worthless, stupid, or ugly, the more you condition yourself to interpret life that way.
  - Once you fall into the habit of seeing people as angry, unjust, or selfish, you see those kind of people everywhere.
- Outrage compounds:
  - Riots, protests, and mass movements are rarely result of single event. Instead, a long series of microagressions.
- The San Antonio Spurs is one of the most successful teams in NBA history:
  - "When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it-but all that had gone before."

##### 1.2.1 The Plateau of Latent Potential

- All big things come from small beginnings.

##### 1.2.2 Forget About Goals, Focus on Systems Instead

- Three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh: "The score takes care of itself."
- Problem #1: Winners and losers have the same goals.
- Problem #2: Achieving a goal is only a momentary change.
  - You need to solve the problems at the systems level.
  - Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.
- Problem #3: Goals restrict your happiness.
  - Goals create an "either-or" conflict: either you succeed or failed.
  - You can be satisfied anytime your system is running.
- Problem #4: Goals are at odds with long-term progress.
  - True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It is not about any single accomplishment.

##### 1.2.3 A System of Atomic Habits

- Small changes often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold.
- The most powerful outcomes of any compounding process are delayed. You need to be patient.

#### 2. How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

- Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons:
  1. We try to change the wrong thing.
     __Three layers of behavior change__
     __i. Changing your outcomes:__ Changing your results. Most of the goals are at this level. i.e. losing weight.
     __ii. Changing your processes:__ Changing your habits and systems. Most of the habits are at this level. i.e. developing a meditation practice.
     __iii. Changing your identity:__ Changing your beliefs. Most of the beliefs, assumptions, and biases you hold are at this level. i.e. your worldview.
  2. We try to change our habits in the wrong way.

- Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs.
- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it.
- Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg.
- Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work.
