## [Deep work](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work)

- A deep life is a good life.
- Deep work is focus ability without distraction on a cognitively demanding task.
- Shallow work is non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style work, often performed while distracted.
- Deep work is like a superpower in our increasingly competitive 21st century economy.
