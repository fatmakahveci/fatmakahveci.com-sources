In 597 AD, the Pope dispatched St. Augustine to reintroduce Christianity to the southern region of England, specifically Canterbury. The remnants of the monastery constructed by Augustine can still be observed today, and he also established England's initial cathedral, which has since been replaced by the splendid structure that stands there now.

For more than 800 years, Canterbury has held significant significance as a pilgrimage destination in Europe, starting from the tragic event of Archbishop Thomas Becket's assassination in 1170. Presently, it stands as one of England's most captivating and historically rich cities, renowned for its beauty.

A portion of the city, encompassing St. Martin's Church, St. Augustine's Abbey, and the Cathedral, has been awarded the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage status.

## St Augustine's Abbey

St. Augustine's Abbey held immense significance as one of the foremost monastic institutions in medieval England. For nearly a millennium, it thrived as a hub of intellectual pursuits and religious devotion. Its establishment arose from the mission to introduce Christianity to England, but tragically, it met its demise and fell into ruins during the period known as Henry VIII's Suppression of the Monasteries.
